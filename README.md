# gmod_addons / SplatoonSWEPs!
This is the huge rework of my existing addon, [SplatoonSWEPs][1].  
Commit messages are all Japanese.

The aim of this rework is the following:
* Working fine on multiplayer game (especially on dedicated servers)
* More flesh than before! (not just throwing props)
* Better UI

***  
## Done
* A new ink system  
    ... but it should be updated for upcoming features
* Inkling base system.  
    You can become inkling as well.
* Basic GUI to change playermodel, ink color, and other settings.  
    GUI menu is in the context menu.
* All Shooters in Splatoon(WiiU).
* All Chargers in Splatoon.

## Currently working on
* Ink system rework
    * It's somewhat glitchy for now.
