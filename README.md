# gmod_addons / SplatoonSWEPs!
This is the huge rework of my existing addon, [SplatoonSWEPs][1].  
Commit messages are all Japanese.

The aim of this rework is the following:
* Working fine on multiplayer game (especially on dedicated servers)
* More flesh than before! (not just throwing props)
* Various options with better UI
    * Drawing crosshair
    * "Southpaw" mode
    * Realistic scope for scoped chargers
    * DOOM-style viewmodel
    * Aim down sight
    * And so on...

***  
## Done
* A new ink system  
    ... but it should be updated for upcoming features
* Inkling base system.  
    You can become inkling as well.
* Basic GUI to change playermodel, ink color, and other settings.  
    GUI menu is in the weapon tab.
* All Shooters in Splatoon(WiiU).
* All Chargers in Splatoon.

## Currently working on
* Ink system rework
    * It's somewhat glitchy for now.
* Splatlings
    * [ ] Create a base class
    * [ ] Write a script for charging
    * [ ] Draw a crosshair
    * [ ] Write a script to spawn the actual ink
    * [ ] Set ink consumption and other parameters

## Upcoming features
* Sub weapons
* Blasters
* Rollers and Inkbrushes
* Sloshers

## I want to make the following, too
* Special weapons in Splatoon and Splatoon 2
* Dualies, Brellas and some Splatoon 2 features.
* Gears and gear abilities

## How to install this project
Though this is still work in progress, you can download and test it.  
If you test it in multiplayer game, all players have to do as well.
* Click **Clone or download** on the top-right, then **Download ZIP**.
* Extract the zip into garrysmod/addons/.
